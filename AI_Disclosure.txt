AI Disclosure

In completing this project, we used AI tools such as GitHub Co-Pilot as a debugging assistant, and Claude as an on-demand tutor 
It was very useful to help understand Java/Spark/Docker/API concepts, and refactor my code more efficiently. 
Below is a summary of how AI was used, with clear attribution.

1. What we used AI for
    a. Debugging & Error Explanation
        We used AI to:
            Learn how to use Powershell and CMD
            Help with debugging errors in JavaScript
            Help with configuring paths to relative directories to avoid hardcoding paths 
            Explain documentation on APISIX
            Explain Youtube tutorials on Docker containerization
            Explain documentation on OkHttp, Jackson, and other libraries when we felt confused
            Explain why APISIX couldn't reach etcd or the API server
            Suggest more readable syntax.

    b. Architectural Guidance
        AI helped us think through:
            What Docker Containerization solves that old tech did not
            How APISIX, etcd, and route-init interact at a conceptual level
            How Maven interprets multi-module projects
            Explain SparkJava concepts
    
    c. Writing Snippets / Patterns
        GitHub copilot auto-generated getters/setters and simple patterns like that
        AI taught us many things creating examples of:
            Example conf.yaml files
            Example JS graphs
            How to use lambdas (from chapter 13) correctly
        
        (These were always manually adapted by us to fit the actual project.)

    d. Suggest revisions for a professional looking README displayed on GitHub for future employment recruiters

2. Interpreting complex error logs from PowerShell, Docker, and Maven 

3. What Was Not Done By AI
        Write or implement methods
        Create Databases
        Create and interpret JSON
        Create class hierarchies
        Set up Docker images or APISIX routes 
        Create file structure
        Build SQLite schema
        Decide the architecture 
        Overall design
        Translating experience with Python Tkinter, Flask, in website design to javascript
